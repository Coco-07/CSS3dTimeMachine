CSS3dTimeMachine
================

This is a demonstration of CSS3 3D Time Machine effect. 

This version is inspired by @joecritchley's demo: http://joecritchley.com/demos/time-machine, which only support Chrome, and requires jQuery libraries.

In this version, browser compatibility are greatly improved. Now Chrome, Safari, Opera, Firefox, and IE(>10) are supported.

Also it eliminated external library dependencies. To run a demo, all you need is just index.html.

Hope it is useful to somebody.
